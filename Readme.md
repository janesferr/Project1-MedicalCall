## Key Topics
The following topics will be covered in this unit:
* JSON
* AJAX
* HTTP GET requests
* Server-side APIs

## Using what we have learn so far, we created an app using APIs found online, to use as a reference to implement in our app.

## MVP, minimum viable product implemented:  Atleast two APIs used in this website: Geolocation and Community Benefit Insight

## Technologies used:
 * JQuery 
 * Foundation as the CSS Framework
 * Google Map API
 * Community Benefit API
 * Webpack

The information you will receive from the app about the hospitals will save you time and will get you the help that you need much faster.

## Description
Our website and app will allow you to locate any hospital closest to you and be able to have direct consultation with their doctors while providing necessary medical guidance.  It also allows you to look at the bed count for each hospital near you and the information and location near your location.

## A feature implemented in the project, was using FIGMA to do the wireframe for the app.

## Another feature was how APIs worked or didn't work.
