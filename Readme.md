- Using what we have learnt so far, we created an app using APIs found online, to use as a reference to implement in our app.

- MVP, minimum viable product implemented: APIs used were, Geolocation and Community Benefit Insight

- Our Git branching worklfow to some work to git use to it. To create separate branches and to push, to pull, to merge and even fetch, it took us a few days and we're still getting used to it.

- We practiced Agile software development in that we made requirements for developing our app and distributed assignments to each team member and made solutions through the collaborative effort by self-organizing and cross-functional teamwork to complete our app.

- A feature implemented in the project, was using FIGMA to do the wireframe for the app.

- Another feature was how APIs worked or didn't work.
